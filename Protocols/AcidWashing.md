	1. Since you are working with HCl. Lab Coat, Examination Gloves, and Safety Goggles are always required.
	1. The fume hood fan must be turned on. 
2. <a name="Prep_Acid_Solution"></a> **Prep_Acid_Solution**
	1. Use marked container under the fume hood labeled 10% HCl in DI water.
	1. Fill container to the line marked "H2O" (11.1L DI water)
		1. **always pour water before acid into your container**
	1. Under the fume hood, carefully pour HCl into container until volume level reaches the line marked "10% HCl in H2O" (1.11L HCl)
3. <a name="Setup_the_bath"></a> **Setup_the_bath**
	1. Carefully pour the 10% HCl in DI Water solution into an appropriate sealable container for the bath.
	1. The fan from the fume hood must be on whenever the lid from the acid bath is open.
		  1. Shut the lid when not in use.
	1. In a separate sealable clean container, fill with the same volume of DI water only (~12L)
4. <a name="Acid_Wash"></a> **Acid_Wash**
    	1. Remove any labels from bottles before washing.
	1. Carefully place the bottles and caps, separated, into the bath 
           1. Submerge the items as much as possible.  The acid can't clean what it's not in contact with.
	1. Shut the lid and let soak for 24 hours.
	1. Using a set of tongs, remove the bottles from the acid bath then place them in the DI-only bath.
	1. Shut the lid for the water bath and soak 24 hours.
5. <a name="Drying"></a> **Drying**
	1. Gather the bottles from the water bath and place them onto a drying mat, with the head in direct contact into the mat.
	1. Once dry, close the bottles with their washed lids and store in a clean place until use.
6. < name="Reuse_and_Disposal"></a> **Reuse_and_Disposal**
	1. Once prepared, the acid bath can be used for multiple washes.  Use litmus paper to check pH before adding new items to the bath.  If pH < 1, the bath can be used for another wash.
	1. The DI water bath can only be used for 2-3 washes.  Use litmus paper to check pH before adding new items to the bath.  If pH ~ 7, the bath can be used for another wash.
	1. If pH falls out of those parameters for the acid bath or DI bath, the solution must be neutralized and then disposed of.  To neutralize the acid, pour baking soda little by little into the solution and carefully stir with a glass stir bar to dissolve the sodium bicarbonate solid.  Test pH with litmus, and if pH < 7 continue to add baking soda and test with litmus until pH reaches 7.  At pH=7 the solution is just water and can be poured down the sink.
